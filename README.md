# EUP Menu for FiveM
A new EUP menu for FiveM!

## Dependencies
This requires the following scripts to work:
- [NativeUILua_Reloaded](https://github.com/sdiaz/NativeUILua_Reloaded) (Must be named `NativeUILua_Reloaded`)

This is currently an incomplete project, and will not work - if you're a server owner, this isn't quite for you yet.

## To-Do:
- Add ability to change outfits
- Add ability to save custom outfits to local config
- Bring overall feature set in line with the singleplayer EUP menu
